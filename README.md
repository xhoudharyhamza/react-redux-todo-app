Create a todo app in react by using redux. As we know that redux is a javaScript state management library that we mostly used with react to manage the components state.

## Prerequisite
To understand the code properly you must have the basic knowledge of react and redux.

## Installation

First, download and install the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
 on your server.

Then check the version of Node.js and npm by running using the following command on cmd.
```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

After that open cmd in any folder and run the following command to create react app in that folder.
```bash
npx create-react-app react-redux-todo-app
cd react-redux-todo-app
``` 
After that use 'npm start' command to run the app
```bash
npm start
``` 


## Dependencies
We use the bootstrap library to make the application UI.

Install bootstrap package
```bash
npm install bootstrap
``` 
After that import the following bootstrap into your App.js file to use bootstrap classes.
```bash
import "bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css";
``` 
After that install redux and react-redux packages.

npm install redux react-redux
```
